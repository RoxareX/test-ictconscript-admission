### Github Page URL:

https://roxarex.github.io/test-ictconscript-admission/


> I have used [Render](https://render.com) for the web service so you can write to the json file <br>

the backend of this is https://test-ictconscript-admission.onrender.com

>[!NOTE]
the above specified site can take up to 50 seconds to load depending on how much it was idle.

>[!NOTE]
So if the json doesn't want to load from the main website its probably because of the same "issue" since its for free it takes longer.


Time to make was approx 1,5h
